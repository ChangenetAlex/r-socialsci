## Course Materials

> The [**Course Materials**](https://datacarpentry.github.io/r-socialsci/){preview-link="true"} were written by [**Data Carpentry**](https://datacarpentry.org/){preview-link="true"}

-   No prior knowledge of R assumed
-   Focus on concepts, skills, and tools for working with data in R (not statistics)
-   The aim is to teach you enough to know how to find out more

## Why R?

```{=html}
<style type="text/css">
p { text-align: left; }
</style>
```

-   One of the most popular languages for data-analysis and statistics
-   It is free, extensible and versatile:
    -   Interactive apps [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), e.g. [shiny app gallery](https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/)
    -   Reproducible research with [Knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/)
    -   [Presentations](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/)
-   Almost 23,000 packages written by the user community
